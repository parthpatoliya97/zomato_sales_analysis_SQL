#### 1.Top 5 Most Frequently Ordered Dishes (by a Specific Customer in Last 1 Year)

- Find the top 5 most ordered dishes by customer Erik Dawson in the last one year.
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        c.customer_name,
        o.order_item AS dishes,
        COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rnk
    FROM orders o 
    JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    WHERE o.order_date > CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR 
      AND c.customer_name = 'Erik Dawson'
    GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name, o.order_item
)
SELECT customer_name, dishes, total_orders
FROM cte
WHERE rnk <= 5;
```

#### 2.Popular Time Slots (2-Hour Buckets)

- Identify peak order times by grouping orders into 2-hour slots.
---
- Manual Sloting
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 0 AND 1 THEN '00:00 - 02:00'
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '02:00 - 04:00'
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '04:00 - 06:00'
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 6 AND 7 THEN '06:00 - 08:00'
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 8 AND 9 THEN '08:00 - 10:00'
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 10 AND 11 THEN '10:00 - 12:00'
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 13 THEN '12:00 - 14:00'
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 14 AND 15 THEN '14:00 - 16:00'
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 16 AND 17 THEN '16:00 - 18:00'
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 18 AND 19 THEN '18:00 - 20:00'
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 20 AND 21 THEN '20:00 - 22:00'
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 22 AND 23 THEN '22:00 - 00:00'
    END AS time_slots,
    COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
FROM orders 
GROUP BY time_slots
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;

```
- Optimal Dynamic Slotting:
```sql
SELECT 
    FLOOR(HOUR(order_time) / 2) * 2 AS start_time,
    FLOOR(HOUR(order_time) / 2) * 2 + 2 AS end_time,
    COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY start_time, end_time
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;

```

#### 3.Average Order Value (AOV) of Frequent Customers
- Find customers who have placed more than 750 orders and calculate their average order value (AOV).
- This identifies super-loyal customers.
```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    AVG(o.total_amount) AS average_order_value,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM orders o 
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name
HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 750;

```
#### 4.High Value Customers
- List customers who have spent over 100K in total on food orders.
- These are premium customers that need loyalty programs.
```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amount) > 100000;

```

#### 5.Orders Without Delivery
- Find orders that were placed but not delivered, grouped by restaurant & city.
- This helps track service failures.
```sql

    r.restaurant_name,
    r.city,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_undelivered_orders
FROM orders o 
LEFT JOIN restaurants r ON o.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id
LEFT JOIN delivery d ON d.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE d.delivery_id IS NULL
GROUP BY r.restaurant_name, r.city
ORDER BY total_undelivered_orders DESC;

```

        r.city,
        SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_revenue,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY r.city ORDER BY SUM(o.total_amount) DESC) AS rnk
    FROM orders o 
    JOIN restaurants r ON o.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id
    WHERE o.order_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR
    GROUP BY r.restaurant_name, r.city
)
SELECT *
FROM cte
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY r.city ORDER BY COUNT(o.order_id) DESC) AS rnk
    FROM orders o 
    JOIN restaurants r ON o.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id
